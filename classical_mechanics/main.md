## Why Lagrange's Equations?

In classical mechanics, Newton's second law describes all the dynamics of a particle / system of particles, and it seems that we just need to turn the mathematical crank (i.e. F = ma) to grind out the motions of everything.
However in many real world problems, Newton's second law is way too simple, making it not applicable. This is especially true when there are restriction conditions, for example a rigid circle rolling on a surface.
To solve these problems, we need a more powerful mathematical device: Lagrange's equations. It's a generalized version of Newton's second law, in that it uses generalized coordinates instead of the traditional Cartesian coordinates.
